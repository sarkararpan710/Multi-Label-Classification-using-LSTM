# Multi-Label-Classification-using-LSTM
Our college mini project that goes about multi label audio classification using LSTM and how we are able to improve accuracy on it.

This Notebook uses code from Jaron's Deeplistening Repository. I reran the entire code for only the RNN part and tried to improve the accuracy
of the model and we were also able to improve the F-score from 0.47 to 0.54. 

It was my first time doing a Deep Learning Project of this kind and it was a good experience.
